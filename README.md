## Hi, I'm Naveed

Welcome to my GitHub portfolio! I am, a passionate and dedicated Software Engineer with a strong background in machine learning, computer vision, and software development. This repository showcases some of my key projects, including drowsiness detection, object detection, and depth estimation. Each project demonstrates my skills in Python programming, deep learning, and practical problem-solving.

Projects
1. Drowsiness Detection
Repository: drowsiness-detection

Overview
This project aims to enhance road safety by detecting driver drowsiness in real-time. The system uses a combination of computer vision techniques and deep learning models to monitor and analyze the driver's eye movements and facial expressions.

Features
Real-time video processing using OpenCV
Eye aspect ratio (EAR) calculation for drowsiness detection
Integration with dlib for facial landmark detection
Alarm system to alert the driver in case of drowsiness
Technologies
Python
OpenCV
dlib
Scikit-learn

2. Object Detection
Repository: object-detection

Overview
This project focuses on detecting and classifying objects in images and videos using state-of-the-art deep learning models. It employs YOLO (You Only Look Once) and Faster R-CNN algorithms for high accuracy and speed.

Features
Support for multiple object detection models
Real-time object detection in video streams
Bounding box visualization for detected objects
Pre-trained models for quick deployment
Technologies
