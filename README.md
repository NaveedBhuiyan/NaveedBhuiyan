## Hi, I'm Naveed

Welcome to my GitHub portfolio! I am, a passionate and dedicated Software Engineer with a strong background in machine learning, computer vision, and software development. This repository showcases some of my key projects, including drowsiness detection, object detection, and depth estimation. Each project demonstrates my skills in Python programming, deep learning, and practical problem-solving.

# ðŸ”­ Projects
1. Drowsiness Detection
Repository: drowsiness-detection

This project aims to enhance road safety by detecting driver drowsiness in real-time. The system uses a combination of computer vision techniques and deep learning models to monitor and analyze the driver's eye movements and facial expressions.


2. Object Detection
Repository: object-detection

This project focuses on detecting and classifying objects in images and videos using state-of-the-art deep learning models. It employs YOLO (You Only Look Once) and Faster R-CNN algorithms for high accuracy and speed.

3. Depth Estimation
Repository: depth-estimation

This project involves estimating the depth of objects in a scene from a single image using deep learning techniques. It helps in applications such as 3D reconstruction, autonomous driving, and augmented reality.

# ðŸ’¬ About Me
I am a Concept developer Engineer for autonomous vehicle at IAV GmbH with expertise in perception and localization. I have extensive experience in developing software solutions and implementing machine learning models. I am passionate about solving complex problems and continuously improving my skills in the field of computer vision and deep learning.
